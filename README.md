# Linear Power Supply Project
## Chase Lotito - Lotito Labs - 06.16.2024

The following project is to learn more about circuit design and PCB design via making a linear power supply.

During this project, I used online resources for the structure of the circuit and KiCAD for schematics and the PCB.

### Design Requirements:
* Input: +120VAC 60Hz connects from mains.
* Output: Variable 0-20VDC @ 3A max.

### Circuit Structure:

120VAC INPUT -> STEP-DOWN TRANSFORMER -> 16VAC -> FULL-BRIDGE RECTIFIER -> FILTER CAPACITOR -> VOLTAGE REGULATOR -> 0-20VDC OUTPUT
